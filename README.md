# SimpleQueue
Minimalist C++ Msg Queue through local socket.

Not very powerfull, just to send commands from one process to another. Can be upgraded for your needs

What take me one day to do in python or powershell asked me 5 days to do in C++ ! COVID's not helping but still...

I find it awfull that there is no simple exemple for this very simple thing on Internet. Now there is one.
